## README

This folder contains the relevant files for plotting the fitting corresponding to modified Density game model (as shown in the paper).  Optimization code that was used for obtaining parameters has not been included. Instead we have provided  '.mat' data files that contain the model parameters (obtained after optimization).  We use these '.mat file' along with the model ( defined in   __modifiedDensityGames.m__) to plot the fitting. The aim is just to verify the plots used in the papers and verify that the model described in paper is indeed used.



### How to use

The user should  run the __main.m__ file for verifying either of the fitting (with or without Cisplatin). The 'pdf' and 'eps' images will be stored in __imagepdf__ folder .
